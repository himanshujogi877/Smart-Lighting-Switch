# Smart-Lighting-Switch
The Smart Lighting System utilizing a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor and an Arduino Uno is an innovative home automation project designed to enhance convenience, energy efficiency, and security.
The Smart Lighting System detects human presence using a PIR sensor and automatically controls the lighting based on the detected motion. The Arduino Uno microcontroller processes the sensor data and manages the switching of lights, providing a seamless, hands-free lighting experience.
Key Components: 1.PIR Sensor: Detects infrared radiation emitted by moving objects, particularly humans. It sends a digital signal to the Arduino when motion is detected. 2.Arduino Uno: A popular microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It processes the input from the PIR sensor and controls the output to the lighting system. 3.Relay Module: An electrically operated switch that allows the Arduino to control high-voltage lighting circuits safely. 4.Power Supply: Provides the necessary power for the Arduino, PIR sensor, and relay module. 5.Light Fixtures: The lighting elements controlled by the system, such as LED bulbs or traditional incandescent lights. 6.Manual Override Switch (Optional): Allows users to manually control the lighting if needed.
How It Works: 1.Detection: The PIR sensor continuously monitors the designated area for motion. When it detects infrared radiation from a moving object, it sends a digital signal to the Arduino. 2.Signal Processing: The Arduino receives the signal from the PIR sensor and executes the pre-programmed logic to determine whether to turn the lights on or off. 3.Switch Activation: If motion is detected, the Arduino activates the relay module, which switches the lights on. 4.Automatic Turn-off: If no motion is detected for a pre-set duration, the Arduino deactivates the relay, turning the lights off to conserve energy.
Features and Benefits: 1.Hands-Free Operation: Automates the process of turning lights on and off, providing convenience and reducing the need for physical interaction. 2.Energy Efficiency: Ensures that lights are only on when needed, leading to significant energy savings and lower electricity bills. 3.Enhanced Security: Automatically illuminates areas when motion is detected, deterring potential intruders and enhancing safety. 4.Customization and Flexibility: The Arduino can be programmed to adjust the sensitivity of the PIR sensor, delay times, and other parameters to suit specific needs. 5.Scalability: Additional PIR sensors and relays can be added to cover larger areas or multiple zones within a building.
Applications: 1.Residential Homes: Ideal for use in hallways, staircases, bathrooms, and garages where automatic lighting can enhance convenience and safety. 2.Commercial Buildings: Suitable for offices, conference rooms, restrooms, and other common areas to ensure lights are not left on unnecessarily. 3.Public Spaces: Enhances safety and efficiency in places like hospitals, schools, and shopping centers by providing automated lighting solutions.
